<p align="center">Stancy/Conquest I love you so much darling, thank you for letting me into your heart â™¡

<p align="center">C+H freely unless said otherwise; INT freely unless DNIUID/DNIUF is in my name.

<p align="center">Please don't hesitate to interact!! I am always interested in meeting new people!! Just don't be weird.

<p align="center">Craig Tucker is a heavy kin of mine, but it doesnâ€™t mean I think I am him. I don't believe in "doubles," so if you kin him too, I couldn't care less. (I also kin Stan & Kyle too, but not as much).


<p align="center"> You can learn more about me by checking out my Pronouns Page and StrawPage!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">Youâ€™re rude or disrespectful.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re super immature: I donâ€™t have time for unnecessary drama, it's not my problem.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re flirty or make people uncomfortable.

<p align="center">You donâ€™t respect boundaries or personal space.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re under 16.

<p align="center">You have DNT/DNB in your name, self-explanatory.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandyâ€™s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have the last two things listed, so I just put them here).

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!!

(Me & The Gang, We're Such Dorks)


Hello! You can call me Charles, I spend a lot of my free time playing Pony Town, itâ€™s very relaxing (Whenever I am not dealing with problematic people). Before interacting, please note that I am an adult and I prefer the Safe Server because the 18+ Server contains slurs and sexual content but sometimes I will go there with my adult friends. I ask that you be at least 16 years old before interacting with me, I take this very seriously.
