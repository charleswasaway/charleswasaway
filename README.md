<p align="center">PLEASE READ:

<p align="center">If you‚Äôre under 16, don‚Äôt interact with me at ALL. If you‚Äôre 16‚Äì17, it‚Äôs fine if you do, but only with extreme caution, absolutely NO flirting or anything weird whatsoever. I‚Äôm honestly pretty iffy about interacting with minors in general, but since I mostly stick to the safe server, it‚Äôs inevitable. You‚Äôre welcome to see me as more of an older sibling or parental figure, but nothing beyond that. And just to be clear, if you‚Äôre under 13, you shouldn‚Äôt even be on the internet to begin with.
  
<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">You‚Äôre extremely rude, immature or disrespectful. 

<p align="center">You‚Äôre racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">You enjoy starting arguments: I don‚Äôt have time for any unnecessary drama, it's not my problem. Take it somewhere else.

<p align="center">You‚Äôre flirty or make people uncomfortable: ANYONE found flirting w/me will be blocked. (Unless it's Stancy ily pookie ‚ô°)

<p align="center">You don‚Äôt respect boundaries or personal space.

<p align="center">You're a pr0sh1pp3r: I don't even want to see people try to excuse it with the "fiction doesn't affect reality" bs. And if you do, just block me because I am not going to ever want to bother with you.

<p align="center">You watch g0r3 content: Anyone who finds enjoyment in these types of videos needs to get off the internet indefinitely.

<p align="center">You spread or try to force religious/political beliefs on others: The last thing I or anyone else needs to see or read is that stuff.

<p align="center">You bully/harass others just because of a ship they like that isn't even problematic.

<p align="center">You like TCOAAL: The story is disgusting, & most of the fans are downright unhinged.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandy‚Äôs World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">Just any other basic DNI criteria, you get the idea. 

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have most of the things listed due to me not feeling like rearranging everything, so I just put them all here. Be sure to check that as well as my Pronouns Page, you'll learn MUCH more about me on those)

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, (WHICH IT SHOULDN'T) PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p align="center">MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:

<p align="center">If you want my Discord, send me a whisper! You MUST be on my friends list, I don't add strangers. 

<p align="center">I love showcasing my cosplays, so if you‚Äôd like to take inspiration from something I‚Äôve made, please just ask first! As long as you‚Äôre not copying the entire cosplay, I don‚Äôt mind people taking a little inspiration. All I ask is that you don't screenshot, record, or upload my cosplays elsewhere. All of my cosplays will have either my Patreon or GitHub linked to them, so please know that if there IS someone using my cosplays, they aren't me.

<p align="center">Any cosplay I am using that has the "üéÅ" emoji in its name was GIFTED TO ME, I did NOT make those cosplays. Huge thank you to the friends who made them for me!! ‚ô°
