NOTE ABOUT THE FLAGS:
You will see both the Bisexual and Lesbian flags on my Pronouns Page. This is not because I identify as both at the same time, but because I’m currently questioning my sexuality and trying to figure out which label feels right for me. Having both flags simply represents where I am in my journey and shows the possibilities I’m considering, not a contradiction.

Next time, don’t stay anonymous if you’re just going to be an asswipe. You could have politely asked me why I had both flags listed, and I would have explained. Yes, I’ll admit I hadn’t posted a full clarification before your comment, but that doesn’t make it acceptable.

My Pronouns Page already states that I’m currently questioning my sexuality, though I could have been more specific. That note was there before I made any updates to that specific page.

(PLEASE READ MY PRONOUNS PAGE BEFORE SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.)

(Me & The Gang, We're Such Dorks)


Hello! You can call me Charles, I spend a lot of my free time playing Pony Town, it’s very relaxing (Whenever I am not dealing with problematic people). Before interacting, please note that I am an adult and I prefer the Safe Server because the 18+ Server contains slurs and sexual content but sometimes I will go there with my adult friends. I ask that you be at least 16 years old before interacting with me, I take this very seriously.

You can learn more about me by checking out my Pronouns Page and StrawPage! I also allow C+H at any time, unless stated otherwise.
Stay safe out there!
