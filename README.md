<p align="center">Stancy/Conquest I love you so much darling, thank you for letting me into your heart. ♡

<p align="center">☆ C+H freely unless said otherwise. ☆

<p align="center">☆ Please don't hesitate to interact w/me whenever I don't have DNIUID/DNIUF in my name, I am always interested in meeting new people!! Just don't be weird. ☆ 

<p align="center">☆ Craig Tucker is a heavy kin of mine, but it doesn’t mean I think I am him. I don't believe in "doubles," so if you kin him too, I couldn't care less. (I also kin Stan & Kyle too, but not as much) ☆

<p align="center">☆ I don't mind ships at all when interacting as long as they aren't problematic/illegal. (I WILL make it clear if I dislike a ship or not) ☆

<p align="center">☆ I love showcasing my cosplays, so if you’d like to take inspiration from something I’ve made, please just ask first! As long as you’re not copying the entire cosplay, I don’t mind people taking a little inspiration. All I ask is that you don't screenshot, record, or upload my cosplays elsewhere. All of my cosplays will have either my Patreon or GitHub linked to them, so please know that if there IS someone using my cosplays, they aren't me. ☆

<p align="center">☆ You can learn more about me by checking out my Pronouns Page & StrawPage! (Be sure to sign my StrawPage before you leave!! I showcase all the gimmicks I receive on there) ☆

<p align="center">NOTE: Any cosplay I am using that has the "🎁" emoji in its name was GIFTED TO ME, I did NOT make those cosplays. Huge thank you to the friends who made them for me!! ♡

<p align="center">EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE:

<p align="center">If you’re under 16, don’t interact with me at ALL. If you’re 16–17, it’s fine if you do, but only with extreme caution, absolutely NO flirting or anything weird whatsoever. I’m honestly pretty iffy about interacting with minors in general, but since I mostly stick to the safe server, it’s inevitable. You’re welcome to see me as more of an older sibling or parental figure, but nothing beyond that. And just to be clear, if you’re under 13, you shouldn’t even be on the internet to begin with.
  
<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">You’re rude or disrespectful.

<p align="center">You’re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">You’re super immature: I don’t have time for unnecessary drama, it's not my problem.

<p align="center">You’re flirty or make people uncomfortable: ANYONE found flirting w/me will be blocked. (Unless it's Stancy ily pookie ♡)

<p align="center">You don’t respect boundaries or personal space: Can't respect these simple things? Expect to get ignored/blocked.

<p align="center">You're a pr0sh1pp3r: I don't even want to see people try to excuse it with the "fiction doesn't affect reality" bs.

<p align="center">You watch g0r3 content: Anyone who finds enjoyment in these types of videos needs to get off the internet indefinitely.

<p align="center">You spread or try to force religious/political beliefs on others: I play this game to escape our harsh and corrupt reality, the last thing I or anyone else needs to see or read is that stuff.

<p align="center">You bully/harass others just because of a ship they like that isn't even problematic.

<p align="center">You like TCOAAL: The story is disgusting, & most of the fans are downright unhinged.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandy’s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have the last few things listed due to me not feeling like rearranging everything, so I just put them all here).

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, (WHICH IT SHOULDN'T) PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!!

<p align="center">(Stary is the best South Park ship ever btw (if you disagree you're wrong/j); Art was drawn by my best friend who also drew my profile picture, love that dude/p @2x2equalsu )
