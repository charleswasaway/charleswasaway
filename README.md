<p align="center">Stancy/Conquest I love you so much darling, thank you for letting me into your heart â™¡

<p align="center">â˜† C+H freely unless said otherwise; INT freely unless DNIUID/DNIUF is in my name. â˜†

<p align="center">â˜† Please don't hesitate to interact w/me whenever I don't have DNIUID/DNIUF in my name, I am always interested in meeting new people!! Just don't be weird. â˜† 

<p align="center">â˜† Craig Tucker is a heavy kin of mine, but it doesnâ€™t mean I think I am him. I don't believe in "doubles," so if you kin him too, I couldn't care less. (I also kin Stan & Kyle too, but not as much) â˜†

<p align="center">â˜† I don't mind ships at all when interacting as long as they aren't problematic/illegal. â˜†

<p align="center">â˜† You can learn more about me by checking out my Pronouns Page and StrawPage! (Be sure to sign my StrawPage before you leave!! I showcase all the gimmicks I receive on there) â˜†

<p align="center">â˜† I love showcasing my cosplays, so if youâ€™d like to take inspiration from something Iâ€™ve made, please just ask first! As long as youâ€™re not copying the entire cosplay, I donâ€™t mind people taking a little inspiration. All I ask is that you don't screenshot, record, or upload my cosplays elsewhere. All of my cosplays will have either my Patreon or GitHub linked to them, so please know that if there IS someone using my cosplays, they aren't me. â˜†

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p align="center">EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE:

<p align="center">I'm an adult, so I want to be upfront about who Iâ€™m comfortable interacting with. If youâ€™re under 16, donâ€™t interact with me at ALL. If youâ€™re 16â€“17, itâ€™s fine if you do, but only with extreme caution, absolutely NO flirting or anything weird whatsoever. Iâ€™m honestly pretty iffy about interacting with minors in general, but since I mostly stick to the safe server, itâ€™s inevitable. Youâ€™re welcome to see me as more of an older sibling or parental figure, but nothing beyond that. And just to be clear, if youâ€™re under 13, you shouldnâ€™t even be on the internet to begin with.
  
<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">Youâ€™re rude or disrespectful.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re super immature: I donâ€™t have time for unnecessary drama, it's not my problem.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re flirty or make people uncomfortable.

<p align="center">You donâ€™t respect boundaries or personal space.

<p align="center">You have DNT/DNB in your name, self-explanatory.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandyâ€™s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have the last two things listed, so I just put them here).

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!!
