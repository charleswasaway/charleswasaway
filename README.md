<p align="center">Stancy/Conquest I love you so much darling, thank you for letting me into your heart ♡

<p align="center">C+H freely unless said otherwise; INT freely unless DNIUID/DNIUF is in my name

<p align="center">Craig Tucker is a heavy kin of mine, but it doesn’t mean I think I am him. I don't believe in "doubles," so if you kin him too, I couldn't care less.

<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">You’re rude or disrespectful

<p align="center">You’re super immature: I don’t have time for unnecessary drama, it's not my problem.

<p align="center">You’re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">You’re flirty or make people uncomfortable.

<p align="center">You don’t respect boundaries or personal space

<p align="center">You’re under 16

<p align="center">You have DNT/DNB in your name, self-explanatory

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandy’s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">You're into Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss (This may seem insensitive, but I genuinely can't stand the fandom, sorry.)

(Me & The Gang, We're Such Dorks)


Hello! You can call me Charles, I spend a lot of my free time playing Pony Town, it’s very relaxing (Whenever I am not dealing with problematic people). Before interacting, please note that I am an adult and I prefer the Safe Server because the 18+ Server contains slurs and sexual content but sometimes I will go there with my adult friends. I ask that you be at least 16 years old before interacting with me, I take this very seriously.

You can learn more about me by checking out my Pronouns Page and StrawPage! I also allow C+H at any time, unless stated otherwise.
Stay safe out there!

⚝ Frequently Used Cosplays! ⚝

Please do not copy these, as anyone found using my cosplays will be immediately blocked. All of my ponies will have either my GitHub or Patreon linked, you can also find my other cosplays on my StrawPage.

DO NOT:

⋆ Copy

⋆ Use as inspiration or reference

⋆ Colorpick

⋆ Screenshot, record, or upload

⋆ Repost or share in any form

This is MY work, not yours. So don't treat it as such.
