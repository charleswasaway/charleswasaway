<p align="center">PLEASE READ:

<p align="center">Anyone under 18, DNI. I’m not comfortable interacting with minors at all. It's nothing personal, I just prefer to keep my online spaces strictly 18+. If you’re under 18, please don’t message, follow, or engage with me. If you're following me on GitHub that's fine as long as you don't try to interact with me (Same goes if you want to C+H). I changed it because I realized my old boundaries were too loose and left a lot of room for misunderstanding. It’s just easier, safer, and way less stressful to have a firm “18+ only” rule instead of trying to manage different age groups and exceptions. It’s not aimed at anyone personally, I just want my space to stay comfortable and avoid any situations that could get weird or be taken the wrong way.
  
<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">You’re extremely rude, immature or disrespectful. 

<p align="center">You’re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">You enjoy starting arguments: I don’t have time for any unnecessary drama, it's not my problem. Take it somewhere else.

<p align="center">You’re flirty or make others uncomfortable: ANYONE found flirting w/me will be blocked.

<p align="center">You don’t respect boundaries or personal space.

<p align="center">You're a pr0sh1pp3r: Self-explanatory, & if you believe fiction doesn't affect reality, because it does. 

<p align="center">You watch g0r3 content: You're not quirky for finding enjoyment in these types of videos. 

<p align="center">You spread or try to force religious/political beliefs on others.

<p align="center">You bully/harass others just because of a ship they like that isn't even problematic.

<p align="center">You like TCOAAL: The story is disgusting, & most of the fans are downright unhinged.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandy’s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">Just any other basic DNI criteria, you get the idea. 

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have most of the things listed due to me not feeling like rearranging everything, so I just put them all here. Be sure to check that as well as my Pronouns Page, you'll learn MUCH more about me on those)

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, (WHICH IT SHOULDN'T) PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!!

<p align="center">MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:

<p align="center">If you want my Discord, send me a whisper! You MUST be on my friends list, I don't add strangers. 

<p align="center">I sometimes play VRChat while I'm on PT, which means I'll be AFK most of the time and most likely won't respond to any messages I get until very late. 

<p align="center">I love showcasing my cosplays, so if you’d like to take inspiration from something I’ve made, please just ask first! As long as you’re not copying the entire cosplay, I don’t mind people taking a little inspiration. All I ask is that you don't screenshot, record, or upload my cosplays elsewhere. All of my cosplays will have either my Patreon or GitHub linked to them, so please know that if there IS someone using my cosplays, they aren't me.

<p align="center">Any cosplay I am using that has the "🎁" emoji in its name was GIFTED TO ME, I did NOT make those cosplays. Huge thank you to the friends who made them for me!! ♡

<p align="center">Craig blinkie was made by @junabuggy on Tumblr!

<p align="center">"Would you guys still be my friend if I were a worm/rock?"

<p align="center">Danny: "Bet"

<p align="center">(Thank you for this art Danny, it's good to know my friends would still love me if I were a worm or a rock)
