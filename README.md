<p align="center">PLEASE READ:

<p align="center">If you’re under 16, don’t interact with me at ALL. If you’re 16–17, it’s fine if you do, but only with extreme caution, absolutely NO flirting or anything weird whatsoever. I’m honestly pretty iffy about interacting with minors in general, but since I mostly stick to the safe server, it’s inevitable. You’re welcome to see me as more of an older sibling or parental figure, but nothing beyond that. And just to be clear, if you’re under 13, you shouldn’t even be on the internet to begin with.
  
<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">You’re extremely rude, immature or disrespectful. 

<p align="center">You’re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">You enjoy starting arguments: I don’t have time for any unnecessary drama, it's not my problem. Take it somewhere else.

<p align="center">You’re flirty or make others uncomfortable: ANYONE found flirting w/me will be blocked.

<p align="center">You don’t respect boundaries or personal space.

<p align="center">You're a pr0sh1pp3r: Self-explanatory, & if you believe fiction doesn't affect reality, because it does. 

<p align="center">You watch g0r3 content: You're not quirky for finding enjoyment in these types of videos. 

<p align="center">You spread or try to force religious/political beliefs on others.

<p align="center">You bully/harass others just because of a ship they like that isn't even problematic.

<p align="center">You like TCOAAL: The story is disgusting, & most of the fans are downright unhinged.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandy’s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">Just any other basic DNI criteria, you get the idea. 

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have most of the things listed due to me not feeling like rearranging everything, so I just put them all here. Be sure to check that as well as my Pronouns Page, you'll learn MUCH more about me on those)

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, (WHICH IT SHOULDN'T) PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!!

<p align="center">MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:

<p align="center">If you want my Discord, send me a whisper! You MUST be on my friends list, I don't add strangers. 

<p align="center">I love showcasing my cosplays, so if you’d like to take inspiration from something I’ve made, please just ask first! As long as you’re not copying the entire cosplay, I don’t mind people taking a little inspiration. All I ask is that you don't screenshot, record, or upload my cosplays elsewhere. All of my cosplays will have either my Patreon or GitHub linked to them, so please know that if there IS someone using my cosplays, they aren't me.

<p align="center">Any cosplay I am using that has the "🎁" emoji in its name was GIFTED TO ME, I did NOT make those cosplays. Huge thank you to the friends who made them for me!! ♡

<p align="center">Craig blinkie was made by @junabuggy on Tumblr!
