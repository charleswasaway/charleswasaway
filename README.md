<p align="center">Stancy/Conquest I love you so much darling, thank you for letting me into your heart ♡

<p align="center">C+H freely unless said otherwise; INT freely unless DNIUID/DNIUF is in my name.

<p align="center">Please don't hesitate to interact w/me whenever I don't have DNIUID/DNIUF in my name, I am always interested in meeting new people!! Just don't be weird. 

<p align="center">Craig Tucker is a heavy kin of mine, but it doesn’t mean I think I am him. I don't believe in "doubles," so if you kin him too, I couldn't care less. (I also kin Stan & Kyle too, but not as much).

<p align="center">I don't mind ships at all when interacting, if I don't like a ship I will let you know. 

<p align="center"> You can learn more about me by checking out my Pronouns Page and StrawPage!

<p align="center">I love showcasing my cosplays, so if you’d like to take inspiration from something I’ve made, please just ask first! As long as you’re not copying the entire cosplay, I don’t mind people taking a little inspiration. All I ask is that you don't screenshot, record, or upload my cosplays elsewhere. All of my cosplays will have either my Patreon or GitHub linked to them, so please know that if there IS someone using my cosplays, they aren't me. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p align="center">EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE:

<p align="center">I'm an adult, so I want to be upfront about who I’m comfortable interacting with. If you’re under 16, don’t interact with me at ALL. If you’re 16–17, it’s fine if you do, but only with extreme caution, absolutely NO flirting or anything weird whatsoever. You’re welcome to see me as more of an older sibling or parental figure, but nothing beyond that. And just to be clear, if you’re under 13, you shouldn’t even be on the internet to begin with.
  
<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">You’re rude or disrespectful.

<p align="center">You’re super immature: I don’t have time for unnecessary drama, it's not my problem.

<p align="center">You’re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">You’re flirty or make people uncomfortable.

<p align="center">You don’t respect boundaries or personal space.

<p align="center">You have DNT/DNB in your name, self-explanatory.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandy’s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have the last two things listed, so I just put them here).

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!!
