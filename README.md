<p align="center">Stancy/Conquest I love you so much darling, thank you for letting me into your heart â™¡

<p align="center">C+H freely unless said otherwise; INT freely unless DNIUID/DNIUF is in my name.

<p align="center">Please don't hesitate to interact!! I am always interested in meeting new people!! Just don't be weird.

<p align="center">Craig Tucker is a heavy kin of mine, but it doesnâ€™t mean I think I am him. I don't believe in "doubles," so if you kin him too, I couldn't care less. (I also kin Stan & Kyle too, but not as much).

<p align="center"> You can learn more about me by checking out my Pronouns Page and StrawPage!

<p align="center">NOTE: I love sharing my cosplays, so if youâ€™d like to take inspiration from something Iâ€™ve made, please just ask first! As long as youâ€™re not copying the entire cosplay, I donâ€™t mind people taking a little inspiration. All I ask is that you don't screenshot, record, or upload my cosplays elsewhere. All of my cosplays will have either my Patreon or GitHub linked to them, so please know that if there IS someone using my cosplays, they aren't me. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p align="center">DNI If:

<p align="center">Youâ€™re rude or disrespectful.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re super immature: I donâ€™t have time for unnecessary drama, it's not my problem.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re racist, homophobic, transphobic, or any kind of bigot.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re flirty or make people uncomfortable.

<p align="center">You donâ€™t respect boundaries or personal space.

<p align="center">Youâ€™re under 16.

<p align="center">You have DNT/DNB in your name, self-explanatory.

<p align="center">You actively support or play Dandyâ€™s World despite being aware of the developer drama. You play it, you support the creator, simple as that, you cannot do one without the other.

<p align="center">(My StrawPage does not have the last two things listed, so I just put them here).

<p align="center">IF SOMETHING ON MY DNI LIST UPSETS YOU, PLEASE JUST HIDE OR BLOCK ME, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE. THANK YOU!!
